#### Comparing Depression Levels of People during 2008 SubPrime Mortgage Crisis v.s. 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic

- This project was for the 2020 Vassar College DataFest sponsored by the college and the American Statistical Association. 
- Compared to the 2008-2009 Subprime Mortage Crisis did people feel more depressed? Did U.S. U.S. government's responses contribute to alleviating people's anxiety/depression? If so, which policies / responses? We explore this question using four datasets - 2009 Tweets Data, Tweets from early Covid period + Tweets from 2020 April, Reddit Comments Data under the depression and AskReddit Sections and the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Dataset.

I am a 3rd year Informatics PhD Student at [UC Irvine](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/grad/phd-informatics/) advised by [Dr. Sean D. Young](http://seanyoungphd.com/). I am a AI Researcher with a background in Data Science and UX Research, hoping to improve healthcare (especially mental health) for the marginalized populations by unlocking the potential of AI. I graduated from Vassar College with a B.A. Degree in Mathematics and minors in Computer Science and Chinese. Until the Summer of 2022, I worked as a Research Data Engineer at [CJARS](https://cjars.isr.umich.edu/), Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan.

In terms of research interests, I am broadly interested in:
- Improving mental health outcomes (e.g. reduce stress, anxiety, depression) of marginalized populations using AI and Large Language Models including international college students in the U.S., the elderly with no access to healthcare etc.
- Responsible and emotional Chatbots and Conversational Agents for improving mental health
- Intersection of AI, Music, and Health (e.g. Music generated by Generative AI to improve mental health at a lower cost)
- Designing Responsible AI systems for health by identifying bias Health AI and propose ways to make them more equitable, transparent, and fair.
- Pre-emptively detecting spread of virus or disease, severe depression, suicide risks, gun violence, drug overdose/addiction by jointly using AI and unstructured data such as social media feeds.
- Very broadly, Data Science and UX projects for Social Good and Health Informatics.

I am also a Amateur Musician who loves to sing, play the drums and perform. Check the My Music section on the upper right hand corner if you want to get to know more about my music! I am always down for music collaborations, so hit me up on my instagram or LinkedIn!

My hometown is Seoul, South Korea. My hobbies are body building, any music activities, exploring beautiful natury areas, discovering new good food places, and analyzing K-dramas.

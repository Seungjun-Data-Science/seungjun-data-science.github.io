I am a Data Scientist who hopes to leverage the power of Data and AI to inform policymakers to make equitable policies, address societal problems and stand on the side of the marginalized in society. I graduated from Vassar College with a B.A. Degree in Mathematics and minors in Computer Science and Chinese.

I am broadly interested in Data Science for Social Good. I am also a Amateur Musician who loves to sing, play the drums and perform. Check the My Music section on the upper right hand corner if you want to get to know more about my music! I am always down for music collaborations, so hit me up on my instagram or LinkedIn!

My hometown is Republic of Korea (South Korea). My hobbies are body building/work out, anything music related, cooking Asian Food, and watching K-dramas.
